# Dicee App

The Dicee app is a simple iOS application that simulates the rolling of two dice. When the user taps the "Roll" button, the app generates random numbers for each die, and the dice images update accordingly to display the rolled numbers.

## Features

The Dicee app includes the following features:

- Rolling two dice simultaneously.
- Displaying random numbers on the dice images.
- User-friendly interface with a single button for rolling the dice.

## Learning Objectives

During the development of this app, I gained knowledge and skills in several areas of iOS app development, including:

### User Interface Design

I learned how to design the app's user interface by using Storyboards in Xcode. This involved creating and positioning UI elements such as buttons and images. I also discovered how to change UI elements programmatically to reflect the app's dynamic behavior.

### User Interaction

I explored how to detect user interactions and respond to them within the app. In the Dicee app, I implemented the functionality to detect when the user taps the "Roll" button and trigger the images to change to a random dice face.

### Swift Variables and Arrays

I learned how to utilize Swift variables and arrays to store and manipulate data within the app. In the Dicee app, I used arrays to manage the dice images.

### Randomization in Swift

I gained knowledge on how to incorporate randomization in Swift. I utilized Swift's random number generation capabilities to simulate the random rolling of the dice and ensure that different numbers appear each time the user taps the "Roll" button.

### AutoLayout

I delved into AutoLayout to create a responsive user interface that adapts to different screen sizes, orientations, and device types. I used various AutoLayout features, including:

- Size classes and orientation: I designed the interface to adapt to different size classes and orientations, ensuring a consistent layout across various devices.
- Constraints: I applied constraints to define the position and size relationships between UI elements, allowing them to adjust dynamically.
- Alignment and pinning: I used alignment and pinning constraints to precisely position UI elements relative to each other or the screen's edges.
- Containers and Stack Views: I leveraged containers and stack views to achieve more fine-grained control over the layout, making it easier to manage the UI elements and their spacing.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.
